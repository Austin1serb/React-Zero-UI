# Create Zero-UI

A blazing-fast React CLI starter powered by **React Zero-UI** — the pre-rendered UI state engine with zero re-renders and zero runtime overhead.

```bash
npx create-zero-ui
```

🏁 Instantly scaffold and patch your **Next.js (App Router)** or **Vite** app with:

✅ Tailwind CSS v4 integration
✅ Zero-UI Babel + PostCSS setup
✅ Autogenerated `data-*` UI state system
✅ One command, production-ready result

---

## 🧠 What is Zero-UI?

Zero-UI is a global UI state engine that updates your interface using `data-*` attributes — **no React state, no VDOM, no re-renders**.

It works by:

1. Scanning your components for `useUI()` hooks
2. Pre-generating Tailwind variants for each UI state
3. Updating `data-*` attributes on `<body>` to drive the UI instantly
